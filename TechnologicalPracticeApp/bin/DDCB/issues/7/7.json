    "Description": "First off, GREAT CONTROL!!! EXACTLY what I was looking for! Well Done! \r\nI must be missing something though, because it fires the SelcetedIndexChanged Event 2 times every time the selections are changed.\r\n\r\nI'm using ASP.NET 4\r\nI have 1 instance of the control on a web form\r\nThe controls' DataSourceID is set to an <asp:SqlDataSource> I have included on the .aspx page\r\nI have written a handler for the SelcetedIndexChanged Event in the code-behind file...but it gets called twice every time the items in the dropdownbox are changed. Any ideas?\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n",
