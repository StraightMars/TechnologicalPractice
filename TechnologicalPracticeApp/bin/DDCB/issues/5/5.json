    "Description": "Hi,\r\nI am using the control on a page with the AjaxControlToolkit 3.5 (ToolkitScriptManager) and am getting the above error from the following script code (which appears to result in the dropdown portion of the control not working).\r\n\r\nDropDownScript.prototype.init = function () { var a = this; if (typeof Sys != \"undefined\") { Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance().add_endRequest(function (c, b) { a.initEvents(); }); }\r\n\r\nWhile I would still like a solution for getting the DropDownCheckBox control working with a ToolkitStriptManager,  I might point out that the above codes representation invarient gives the rule  \"PageRequestManager must not be null\"  because it has the dependency  .getInstance() that requires a valid object reference.    Since it [PageRequestManager] appears to be null in some cases (and is thus creating an exception to the rule), one might want to add some exception handling.",
