If I change the DropDownCheckboxes control visibility to true on a UpdatePanel postback, I get a \"Microsoft JScript runtime error: 'DropDownScript' is undefined\". The client-side script may not be registering. I'm wondering if tehre is a work-around for this, other than refreshing the entire page?",

When I tried to databind the controls in code behind that's when I got that error.\n\nIf the control is used declaratively everything is fine.  So my workaround is to declaratively put a control on the page and set its display property to false. (The Visible must be true otherwise the required scripts won't be added)\n\n<div style=\"display:none\">\n<asp:DropDownCheckBoxes ID=\"ddcbPlaceHolderToAddRequiredScripts\" runat=\"server\" Visible=\"true\">\n</asp:DropDownCheckBoxes> \n</div>    \n\nIf anyone has a better solution please let me know.",
