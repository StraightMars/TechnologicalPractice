    "Description": "Firstly: THANK YOU! This is one cool control that puts the MS team to shame.\r\n\r\nI have a display problem when I publish the solution in production. \r\n\r\nOn dev. (VS2010) it looks perfect and works as it should. But when I put it in production (Server 2003 IIS 6, Framework 4.0.30319 the control when expanded is displayed under the one beneath.  I attached a screen grab but in a few words: if I have two dropdown checkboxlists one just beneath the other and I try to expand the upper one, the effect I get is that the lower one remains visible and the extended list is under the lower one. \r\nI did not implement any changes to CSS.  I only added this line to get the size and text: \r\n<Style SelectBoxCssClass=\"\" SelectBoxWidth=\"300\" DropDownBoxBoxWidth=\"300\" DropDownBoxBoxHeight=\"\"></Style>\r\n<Texts SelectAllNode=\"Select all\" SelectBoxCaption=\"Peripheral Events\"></Texts>   \r\n\r\nEdit: It works in Chrome and FF, it's only IE that has this problem. \r\n\r\nThank you again for the control and for any help with this issue you might be able to provide.\r\n//Florin\r\n",

All encoded values (viewstate, event validation hidden field) due to different machine keys\n2. Pathes to web resources - due to different location on the machines\n\nThese differences can't influence the way the page is rendered since the markup is the same. \n\nAlso the same effect as in the provided picture is present when IE8 is working in compatibility mode (in IE8 I've reproduced it only in compatibility mode). Unfortunately I didn't find any quick fix to this issue. Seems like in compatibility mode IE8 handles z-index CSS property differently which doesn't allow the drop down DIV do be on top of the top level DIVs rendered by rest controls.",
