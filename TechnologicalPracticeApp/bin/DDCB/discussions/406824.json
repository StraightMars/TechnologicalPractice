It also does not happen when I am debugging in VS 2010 and the page is hosted by the ASP.NET Development Server.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;I confirmed this issue on a “hello world” type page in a site with no CSS files. So I don’t think there is anything else affecting it.<br>\r\nAnybody seen this before and know of a solution?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,&nbsp;&nbsp; John Gilbert</p>\r\n",
