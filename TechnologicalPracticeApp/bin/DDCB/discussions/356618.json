The column is a DateTime (e.g. 2010-09-03 13:29:58). We have tried to format the value displayed in the drop down such that it looks like 03/09/2010 using DropDownCheckBox.DataTextFormatString\r\n = &quot;{0:mm/dd/yyyy}&quot; but it doesn't seem to format the values properly. Any suggestions or are we attempting to format incorrectly?</p>\r\n",
